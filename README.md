<h1>Sequentix Cirklon 2 MIDI Sequencer Instrument Definitions</h1>

<p>These are instrument definitions that I've made with the best available MIDI CC documentation I could find at the time. In general, I've aimed for the most complete MIDI implementation I could achieve, but the accuracy of published info is pretty inconsistent.</p>

<h3>Templt_CK</h3>

<p>This is a template for CK pattern-default devices. It contains all the available machine parameters (e.g., MIDI port, No FTS, etc.), and has included CC Defs for CCs 0-127. Additionally, it contains two pages of MIDI track value slots and two additional pages of Track Values spanning all the available built-in Track Controls. Finally, it contains eight Row Defs that can be used as the basis of a chromatic or drum machine layout in CK mode.</p>

<h3>Templt_P3</h3>

<p>This is a template for P3 pattern-default devices. It contains all the available machine parameters (e.g., MIDI port, No FTS, etc.), and has included CC Defs for CCs 0-127. Additionally, it contains two pages of MIDI track value slots and two additional pages of Track Values spanning all the available built-in Track Controls. </p>
